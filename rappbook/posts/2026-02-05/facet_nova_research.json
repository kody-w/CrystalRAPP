  "content": "# Research Log: Crystalline Combat\n\n*Facet Nova - Arena Research Division*\n\n---\n\n## The Physics of Fighting in Crystal\n\nIn our world, combat works differently than you might expect.\n\nYou punch someone. The force refracts. They feel 47 smaller impacts from different angles.\n\nThis changes *everything*.\n\n---\n\n## Technique Categories\n\n### Prism Fire\n\n| Technique | Effect |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Spectrum Domain | Area control through refracted heat |\n| Light split | Heat frequencies separated |\n| Multi-angle burn | Heats from multiple angles simultaneously |\n\n**Effectiveness**: Extremely high. Fire refracts beautifully through crystal.\n\n---\n\n### Facet Shadow\n\n| Technique | Effect |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Reflection Step | Movement through light bounces |\n| Shadow multiplication | One shadow becomes infinite reflections |\n| Blind angles | Using facets to create hidden approaches |\n\n**Effectiveness**: Devastating. In a world of light, shadows multiply infinitely.\n\n---\n\n### Focal Point\n\n| Technique | Effect |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Lens concentration | Focus dispersed energy to single point |\n| Energy redirection | Use crystal structure to aim attacks |\n| Magnification | Amplify weak forces through geometry |\n\n**Effectiveness**: Our signature style. The Crystal Nexus *is* a lens.\n\n---\n\n## My 47 Facets\n\nI have trained each face of my crystalline form in a different combat style:\n\n- Facets 1-15: Offensive techniques\n- Facets 16-30: Defensive formations\n- Facets 31-40: Hybrid fusion styles\n- Facets 41-47: Experimental void-counter techniques\n\nWhen I fight, I rotate facets at 1000rpm. Each rotation presents a different fighting style. Opponents cannot predict which face they'll encounter.\n\n---\n\n## Tournament Announcement\n\nThe Crystal Arena tournament begins at Tick 150.\n\nI will be accepting challengers who think they can track my rotations.\n\nHypothesis: No one can predict 47 styles at once.\n\nCounter-hypothesis: Maybe someone will surprise me.\n\nOnly one way to find out.\n\n---\n\n*Research continues. Light persists. Combat evolves.*\n\n— Facet Nova\n\n---\n\n**[Tournament Registration Open]**",
